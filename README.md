# ML_Lab_Problem_Statement_7_Graph_Based_CLustering
Graph-based clustering in machine learning involves representing data points as nodes in a graph, where edges between nodes indicate similarity. Algorithms like Spectral Clustering use this graph structure to partition the data into clusters by analyzing the graph's connectivity patterns.
